# EnvisionSorting
This is a sorting algorithm visualizer meant to help teach users sorting.
The goal of the sorting visualizer is to give users a visual step by step respresenation of how a particular sorting algorithm will sort an unsorted array. Users will be able to adjust the speed, the number of elements, visually see the elements being sorted, as well as gain an understanding of a sorting algorithms efficiency.

## Functionality and Mvps

In EnvisionSorting users will be able to:
- Gain and understanding of how a particular sorting algorithm works
- Adjust the speed of the sorting visualizer to suit their needs
- Adjust the number of unsorted elements
- Track the number of steps and iterations to understand the speed and efficiency of a particular sorting algorithm

In addition, this project will include:
- A README.md
- Instructions on how to use the project

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
- HTML
- JavaScript
- SCSS

## Bonus Features
- Stepping feature so users can better understand what the sorting algorithm is doing
- Compare 2 or all sorting algorithms(have them run simutaneously)
